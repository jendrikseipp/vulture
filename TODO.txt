TODO
====

* Differentiate between functions and methods (for our purposes methods
  are functions with a "self" parameter and they are stored as
  attributes, not as variables)
* Parse all variable names in new format strings (vars with special formatting, etc.)
  Use string.Formatter.parse for this.
* Allow using vulture as a module. Possibly using pyflakes as an example.
* Remove Python 2.6 compatibility and use argparse.
* Use drone.io matrix build once it is supported.
* Use astroid if we ever want to support scopes.


Non-Todo
========

* Ignore hidden files and directories (might be unexpected, use --exclude instead).
